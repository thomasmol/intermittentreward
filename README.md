# Intermittent rewards, a tool

## Why you should use this:
Rewards can be a powerful motivator, and giving yourself a reward at random after completing a hard task can improve your performance and enjoyment of the task.
### 💡 Here's why:
 - 🎰 Similar to how casinos work, the anticipation of potentially receiving a reward can motivate individuals to put in more effort into the task.
 - 🎲 The randomness of the reward adds an element of unpredictability and novelty, making the task more engaging and enjoyable.
 - 🔁 This creates a positive feedback loop, where the individual becomes more motivated to complete the task and receives a reward, increasing their motivation and enjoyment.

So next time you're faced with a challenging task, consider rewarding yourself at random for a boost in performance and enjoyment. 💪
